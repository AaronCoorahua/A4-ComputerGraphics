Assignment: MP - Over Hill and Under Hill
Description: This program renders a 3D scene with our three Heroes, all of which can be moved around and given an Arcball Cam relative to them. The program also implements a first-person perspective for each Hero, a Free Cam, Vertex and Fragment shaders, Illumination with a directional light, point light, and spotloght, and a textured skybox.
Running, Compiling, and Keys: The program should be compiled and ran through CLion, setting the working directory to '..'. The 'WASD' keys will move the selected Hero. Use the 'Z', 'X', and 'C' keys to change between Heroes. The '1' key will enable/disable a first-person camera for the selected Hero. The '2' will activate the Free Cam which can be reverted by selecting a Hero again. Finally, 'Q' or 'Escape' will close the program.
Responsibility Distribution: Aaron contributes to setting up the project in addition to Section A, Section B, and the Extra Credit. Seth contributed to Sections C and D. Ross contributed to Section E.
Time: This assignment took X hours.
